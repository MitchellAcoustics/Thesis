\chapter*{Declaration}
% The title page should be followed by a signed declaration that the work presented in the thesis is the candidate's own:
I, Andrew Mitchell, confirm that the work presented in this thesis is my own. Where information has been derived from other sources, I confirm that this has been indicated in the thesis.

\chapter*{Abstract}
% The signed declaration should be followed by an abstract consisting of no more than 300 words


\chapter*{Impact Statement}
% The abstract should be followed by an impact statement consisting of no more than 500 words.
The statement should describe, in no more than 500 words, how the expertise, knowledge, analysis, discovery or insight presented in your thesis could be put to a beneficial use. Consider benefits from \textbf{inside} and \textbf{outside} academia and the ways in which these benefits could be brought about.

\chapter*{COVID-19 Statement}

In March of 2020, 18 months into the development of this thesis, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the UK, forcing it into lockdowns which would continue for over a year. Solely by good fortune and a tendency to speed ahead with too-little thought, the primary data collection had fortunately been completed prior to the first lockdown. However, this work was impacted in three ways: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Further in-situ data collection could not be completed, reducing the range of soundscape types we could include;
    \item The unprecedented and stressful world of the pandemic had a significant mental health and social impact, the effects of which cannot be quantified, nor overstated;
    \item In response to the unique scientific opportunity of a world-wide transportation and social lockdown, new, unplanned studies were carried out. 
\end{enumerate}

In particular, this final point has had an impact on the structure and content of this thesis. Certain aspects of the research, in particular the model development and building, were accelerated and put into practice to investigate the impacts of the COVID lockdowns, before being returned to and further developed. The initial research plan would have followed a more logical path of nailing down the model development first, then moving on to a first implementation. In addition, new work was added to this thesis which may appear incongruous or unrelated, but represents a great deal of necessary work which further informed the key strains of the thesis.
