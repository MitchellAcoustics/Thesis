\chapter*{Impact Statement}
% The abstract should be followed by an impact statement consisting of no more than 500 words.
The statement should describe, in no more than 500 words, how the expertise, knowledge, analysis, discovery or insight presented in your thesis could be put to a beneficial use. Consider benefits from \textbf{inside} and \textbf{outside} academia and the ways in which these benefits could be brought about.

\chapter*{COVID-19 Statement}

In March of 2020, 18 months into the development of this thesis, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the UK, forcing it into lockdowns which would continue for over a year. Solely by good fortune and a tendency to speed ahead with too-little thought, the primary data collection had fortunately been completed prior to the first lockdown. However, this work was impacted in three ways:

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Further in-situ data collection could not be completed, reducing the range of soundscape types we could include;
      \item The unprecedented and stressful world of the pandemic had a significant mental health and social impact, the effects of which cannot be quantified, nor overstated;
      \item In response to the unique scientific opportunity of a world-wide transportation and social lockdown, new, unplanned studies were carried out.
\end{enumerate}

In particular, this final point has had an impact on the structure and content of this thesis. Certain aspects of the research, in particular the model development and building, were accelerated and put into practice to investigate the impacts of the COVID lockdowns, before being returned to and further developed. The initial research plan would have followed a more logical path of nailing down the model development first, then moving on to a first implementation. In addition, new work was added to this thesis which may appear incongruous or unrelated, but represents a great deal of necessary work which further informed the key strains of the thesis.

\section{Impacts of Urban Noise on Health and Wellbeing}

\section{Current Methods of Assessing and Addressing Urban Noise}
 The approach to a practical predictive soundscape model arrived at within this thesis is heavily based on past environmental acoustics approaches, I will therefore begin with a brief summary of these past approaches.

 \chapter{Studies \& Summaries}

 The following studies form the core of this thesis, with each contributing a key component of the soundscape modelling process. They are presented in a logical, rather than chronological order and are each preceded by a brief summary.

 \newpage
\section[Commentary]{Commentary: Supportive Soundscapes are Crucial for Sustainable Cities and Communities}

 Presented as a \textit{Comment} paper in Nature Sustainability, this paper provides an opininated view towards the placement of soundscape in future sustainability research and development. Heavily shaped and primarily drafted by me, it puts forth the argument that cities and communities cannot be sustainably designed without a consideration of 1) how noise impacts the community, and 2) how the community impacts the existing soundscape. \misc{add a bit about the agenda presented}

 Although published towards the end of my PhD, it is placed at the beginning as it offers our strongest argument for the necessity of soundscape in future sustainable design. It situates noise as a key environmental concern and provides a justification for a soundscape approach, which requires and incorporates predictive tools to be applied in engineering, research, and design contexts.

 \newpage
\section[Protocol]{Protocol: The Soundscape Indices (SSID) Protocol: A Method for Urban Soundscape Surveys -- Questionnaires with Acoustical and Contextual Information}

 Conducting urban soundscape studies on a scale large enough to form a machine learning dataset presents a unique challenge. The standardised methods of conducting soundscape surveys \citep{ISO12913_2_2018IOS} are labour-intensive, time-consuming, and provide limited information about the acoustical and environmental context.
