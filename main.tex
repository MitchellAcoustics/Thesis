\chapter*{Abstract}
% The signed declaration should be followed by an abstract consisting of no more than 300 words
Urban noise pollution affects 80 million EU citizens with substantial impacts on public health which are not well addressed by conventional noise control methods. Traditional noise control methods typically limit their focus to the reduction of unwanted noise, ignoring the benefits of increasing positive sounds and remaining restricted by practical limitations of noise reduction. Modern approaches to achieve improved health outcomes and public satisfaction aim to incorporate the perception of an acoustic environment, an approach known as ‘Soundscape’.

When attempting to apply soundscape in practical applications, it is immediately apparent that a predictive model of the users’ perceptual response to the acoustic environment is necessary. Whether to determine the impact of a design change, or to integrate large scale data at neighbourhood and city levels, a mathematical model of the interacting factors forms a vital component of the implementation of the soundscape approach.

Previous soundscape research has demonstrated that perception of the acoustic environment, while primarily driven by sound level, is mediated heavily by non-acoustic factors which interact with the sound level, spectral information, and temporal acoustic behaviour in complex ways. The soundscape is influenced by several levels of factors: the immediate and long-term acoustic environment, other environmental factors (e.g. temperature, air quality), the physical / visual characteristics and type of space, and even cultural and country-level expectations. When approached in a predictive model context, the acoustic data must form the core components, but a coherent framework for describing how the influence of the acoustic factors is affected by non-acoustic factors is required.  Through the combination of in-person field questionnaires and multi-factor characterisation of the environment, my research will focus on building up the levels of analysis and, finally, on integrating these levels and factors into an overall soundscape predictive model which focusses on interpretability and potential for practical use.

\chapter*{COVID-19 Statement}

In March of 2020, 18 months into the development of this thesis, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the UK, forcing it into lockdowns which would continue for over a year. Solely by good fortune and a tendency to speed ahead with too-little thought, the primary data collection had fortunately been completed prior to the first lockdown. However, this work was impacted in three ways:

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Further in-situ data collection could not be completed, reducing the range of soundscape types we could include;
      \item The unprecedented and stressful world of the pandemic had a significant mental health and social impact, the effects of which cannot be quantified, nor overstated;
      \item In response to the unique scientific opportunity of a world-wide transportation and social lockdown, new, unplanned studies were carried out.
\end{enumerate}

In particular, this final point has had an impact on the structure and content of this thesis. Certain aspects of the research, in particular the model development and building, were accelerated and put into practice to investigate the impacts of the COVID lockdowns, before being returned to and further developed. The initial research plan would have followed a more logical path of nailing down the model development first, then moving on to a first implementation. In addition, new work was added to this thesis which may appear incongruous or unrelated, but represents a great deal of necessary work which further informed the key strains of the thesis.

\section*{Background and aims}

 \subsection*{Positivity (or the absence of negativity?)}
       From the experience of the previous studies which are highly focused on the existing environmental acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics, one (of many) potential limitations has been revealed. For the most part, these metrics were designed to characterise various negative qualities of the sound. Certainly, they therefore have a negative correlation with positive assessments of the sound, but the simple fact is that they were conceived of and implemented in an attempt to quantify some sonic characteristic that was assumed by the researchers to contribute to a negative perception. Hence why in Zwicker's empirical formula for Psychoacoustic Annoyance \citep{PsychoacousticsfactsmodelsZwicker} $PA = N_5 (1 + \sqrt{\omega^2_S + \omega^2_{FR}})$, all of the constituent parts have positive coefficients.

       While this would not theoretically hinder a formula for describing positive aspects of the sound, it creates a sort of conceptual barrier. If all of these metrics are designed to capture negative aspects of the sound, then it is insufficient to use them create a formula to describe a positive sound, since that formula would only represent the 'absence of negativity', not necessarily positivity.
