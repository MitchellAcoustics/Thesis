\chapter*{Abstract}
% The signed declaration should be followed by an abstract consisting of no more than 300 words (one page)
Conventional noise control methods typically limit their focus to the reduction of unwanted noise, ignoring the benefits of positive sounds and struggling to reflect the totality of noise impacts. Modern approaches to achieve improved health outcomes and public satisfaction aim to incorporate the perception of an acoustic environment, an approach known as `soundscape'. When attempting to apply soundscape in practice, it is apparent that new methods of analysing soundscape perception in urban spaces are required; in particular, a predictive model of the users' perceptual response to the acoustic environment is necessary. This thesis is intended to enable a move towards applying engineering approaches to soundscape design. This is achieved by developing predictive models of soundscape perception through empirical studies examining a large scale soundscape assessment database. The results are presented in three parts: first, the data collection protocol and modelling methods developed for this work are presented; the second part demonstrates an initial development and application of a predictive soundscape model; the final section expands upon this initial model with two empirical studies exploring the potential for additional information to be included in the model.

This thesis begins by establishing a protocol for large scale soundscape data collection based on ISO 12913-2 and the creation of a database containing 1,318 responses paired with 693 binaural recordings collected in 13 locations in London and Venice. The first study then presents an initial development and application of a model designed to predict soundscape perception based on psychoacoustic analysis of the binaural recordings. Through the collection of an additional 571 binaural recordings during the COVID-19 lockdowns, sound level reductions at every location are seen, ranging from a reduction of 1.27 dB(A) in Regents Park Japan to 17.33 dB(A) in Piazza San Marco, with an average reduction across all locations of 7.27 dB(A). Multi-level models were developed to predict the overall soundscape pleasantness ($R^2=0.85$) and eventfulness ($R^2=0.715$) of each location and applied to the lockdown recordings to determine how the soundscape perception likely changed. The results demonstrated that perception shifted toward less eventful soundscapes and to more pleasant soundscapes for previously traffic-dominated locations but not for human- and natural-dominated locations. The modelling process also demonstrated that contextual information was important for predicting pleasantness but not for predicting eventfulness.

The next stage of the thesis considers a series of expansions to the initial model. The second piece of empirical work makes use of a dataset of recordings collected from a \glsfirst{wasn} which includes sound source labels and annoyance ratings collected from 100 participants in an online listening study. A multilevel model was constructed using a combination of psychoacoustic metrics and sound source labels to predict perceived annoyance, achieving an $R^2$ of 0.64 for predicting individual responses. The sound source information is demonstrated to be a crucial factor, as the relationship between roughness, impulsiveness, and tonality and the predicted annoyance varies as a function of the sound source label. The third piece of empirical work uses multilevel models to examine the extent to which personal factors influence soundscape perception. The findings suggest that personal factors, including psychological wellbeing, age, gender, and occupational status, account for approximately 1.4\% of the variance for pleasantness and 3.9\% for eventfulness, while the influence of the locations accounted for approximately 34\% and 14\%, respectively. 

Drawing from the experience gained working with urban soundscape data, a new method of analysing and presenting the soundscape perception of urban spaces is developed. This method inherently considers the variety of perceptions within a group and provides an open-source visualisation tool to facilitate a nuanced approach to soundscape assessment and design. Based on this empirical evidence, a framework is established for developing future predictive soundscape models which can be integrated into an engineering approach. At each stage, the results of these studies is discussed in terms of how it can contribute to a generalisable predictive soundscape model.

\chapter*{Impact Statement}
% The abstract should be followed by an impact statement consisting of no more than 500 words.
This thesis presents a practical approach for integrating soundscape into engineering design approaches, through the development of detailed proposals towards a generalisable predictive soundscape model. This work is of relevance to the research community, designers, policy-makers, and the general public. 

Firstly, the predictive model proposed is highly relevant to urban planning, allowing for hypothetical assessment of a soundscape before the urban space is built or iterative testing of proposed design elements. This is likely to result in more efficient use of resources, better public health outcomes, and more enjoyable public spaces. More immediately, the soundscape visualisation tool presented (\texttt{soundscapy}) is a nuanced means of communication which can be used within the research community as well as between soundscape practitioners and urban designers, regulators, artists, and lay-people.

This work is also of relevance to policy-makers, as the approaches proposed enable more advanced tools for soundscape assessment and the implementation of policy guidelines. There has been regulatory interest in moving towards a more perceptual approach to urban sound environments, from protecting quiet areas to creating vibrant spaces. The generalisable predictive model proposed in this thesis would provide a practical tool for implementing this. 

The methods developed and data collected throughout the course of this thesis also contribute to the soundscape research communities. A thorough protocol for soundscape data collection (SSID Protocol) is outlined, which has already been replicated by several research groups across Europe and China. An important aspect of the work in this thesis is their open access publication. The open publication of The International Soundscape Database (ISD) provides a starting point which can be adapted, reanalysed, and to which new data can be added. In addition, the \texttt{soundscapy} visualisation tool has been made open source to make it as accessible, flexible, and reproducible as possible and to become a key component of the soundscape  designer's toolbox of the future. 

The results of the empirical studies provide evidence for shaping future soundscape research and for rethinking the results of noise level reductions. By taking a perceptual approach to investigating the impact of drastic traffic flow reductions as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns, the potential -- or lack thereof -- that reductions in traffic noise have for improving urban soundscapes is better revealed. 

Finally, this research is beneficial to the general public. The visualisation tools developed in this thesis can be used for communication and outreach, enabling people to become more aware and educated about the sound environments they experience. Most importantly, the models proposed in this thesis could help create higher quality soundscapes in urban spaces, leading to improved public health outcomes, more effective use of tax-payers' money, and increased enjoyment of urban spaces.

\section*{Introduction}
The first key step toward developing a predictive soundscape model is the creation of a coherent, large-scale, multi-factor database of objective environmental measurements and subjective perceptual responses. Conducting urban soundscape studies on a scale large enough to form a machine learning dataset presents a unique challenge. The standardised methods of conducting soundscape surveys \citep{ISO12913Part2} are often labour-intensive and time-consuming to collect a large amount of data, and may provide limited information about the acoustical and environmental context. Towards this, we developed an in depth soundscape assessment protocol based on \citet{ISO12913Part2}. 

Due to the nature of this data collection method as a novel contribution submitted as its own journal paper, the methodology section has been split into two sections: \cref{chap:protocol} presents the data collection protocol as its own, stand-alone contribution, and \cref{chap:methods} then presents the data analysis and modelling methods made use of throughout the rest of the thesis.

\part{An Initial Application of Predictive Soundscape Modelling}
\label{part:Lockdown}
\section*{Introduction}

The ability to predict the likely soundscape assessment of urban spaces has great potential for bringing a soundscape focus to design, but it also unlocks new opportunities to track how urban spaces change. In order to demonstrate this potential, and to give a practical example of the principles outlined in this thesis, this part presents a novel application of predictive soundscape modelling used to track how the \gls{covid19} lockdowns impacted urban soundscapes. The model presented in \cref{ch:lockdown}\footnote{The study presented in \cref{ch:lockdown} has been published as \citep{Mitchell2021Investigating} in a special issue on \gls{covid19} Pandemic Acoustic Effects. } represents a first step which will be further built upon and developed throughout the following chapters in \cref{part:generalModel}.

\part{Towards a Generalisable and Probabilistic Soundscape Model}
\label{part:generalModel}
\section*{Introduction}
\cref{ch:lockdown} has demonstrated a novel application of predictive soundscape modelling. Given the conditions of the \gls{covid19} lockdowns, existing soundscape assessment methods were impractical (or illegal) to implement. As outlined in \cref{ch:lit}, this is an example of one of the scenarios where predictive modelling is necessary, as the existing \emph{post-hoc} survey methods cannot be used. Other applicable scenarios include: soundscape mapping, predicting soundscapes of not-yet-existing spaces, unattended sensor networks, and long-term soundscape monitoring.

The model in \cref{ch:lockdown} represents an advance for current soundscape methods and provided valuable insight into the likely soundscape during the \gls{covid19} lockdown. However, it does not yet represent a generalisable soundscape model which would be necessary to address these other applications of predictive modelling. I therefore present a forward-looking proposal for expanding this model.

In \cref{ch:bayes} I develop the overall goals of a generalised predictive soundscape model and the development constraints that these requirements place on such a model. I describe how we can begin to build on the model from \cref{ch:lockdown}, incorporating architectural and visual information, and make it generalisable to new locations, contexts, and applications.

\cref{ch:mlmann} addresses the necessity of incorporating semantic information about the sound source type into a model for predicting soundscape perception. I illustrate how this information can be integrated by presenting the results of a study on predicting noise annoyance with a \gls{mlm} incorporating sound source information \citep{Orga2021Multilevel}\footnote{The content in this study and chapter are my own work, conducted as part of this thesis. I shared first-authorship with Dr. Ferran Orga for the published version and his contributions to the text included in the chapter are clearly marked and referenced.}. Finally, I discuss how sound source information could be integrated into the general model in an automated way.

In \cref{ch:whostudy}, I investigate to what extent personal factors (e.g. age, gender, psychological well-being) influence soundscape perception. I constructed a third \gls{mlm} and performed feature selection to determine the relative importance of these personal factors \citep{Erfanian2021Psychological}\footnote{The content in this study and chapter are my own work, conducted as part of this thesis. I shared co-authorship with Ms. Mercede Erfanian for the published version and her contributions to the text included in the chapter are clearly marked and referenced.}. Several approaches for how this information could be integrated into a practical predictive model are proposed, following the constraints laid out in \cref{ch:bayes}.

Finally, in \cref{ch:ProbabilisticPOC}, I present a new method for analysing and representing soundscape assessments, published as \citet{Mitchell2022How}. This method emphasises the necessity of considering the variation in people's responses to a soundscape. Given this variation, the soundscape of a space cannot be represented by an single person's assessment, but is better thought of as a collective perception. As such, the method I have developed represents a soundscape as a distribution of soundscape assessments. This chapter introduces this visualisation method and its implications and provides a workflow for how a predictive soundscape model can reflect this consideration of the natural variation in perception.
