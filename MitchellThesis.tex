\draft{Need to update the abstract and impact statements}
Urban noise pollution affects 80 million EU citizens with impacts on public health which are not well addressed by conventional noise control methods. These methods typically limit their focus to the reduction of unwanted noise, ignoring the benefits of positive sounds and remaining restricted by practical limitations of noise reduction. Modern approaches to achieve improved health outcomes and public satisfaction aim to incorporate the perception of an acoustic environment, an approach known as ‘Soundscape’.

When attempting to apply soundscape in practice, it is apparent that new methods of analysing soundscape perception in urban spaces are required; in particular, a predictive model of the users’ perceptual response to the acoustic environment is necessary. Whether to determine the impact of an environmental change, or to integrate large scale data at neighbourhood and city levels, a mathematical model of the interacting factors forms a vital component of the implementation of the soundscape approach.

This thesis presents the results of several studies which develop the conceptual and statistical frameworks to enable the prediction and presentation of the soundscape analysis of urban spaces. The first and final studies present the conceptual developments, including a new protocol for conducting soundscape assessments, the creation of a large-scale international database, and a novel method of representing the soundscape of an urban space. The key chapters trace the development of a multilevel linear regression model of soundscape perception. The first iteration of this model revealed how soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness are mediated by psychological well-being and demographic factors. The second makes use of sound source information to inform the statistical relationships between psychoacoustic metrics and noise annoyance, demonstrating that loudness is a crucial factor, regardless of the sound type. Finally, a context-aware model was put into practical use to investigate how the soundscapes of urban spaces were impacted by the COVID-19 lockdowns in a situation where previous assessment methods were impractical.

\chapter*{Impact Statement}
% The abstract should be followed by an impact statement consisting of no more than 500 words.
The statement should describe, in no more than 500 words, how the expertise, knowledge, analysis, discovery or insight presented in your thesis could be put to a beneficial use. Consider benefits from \textbf{inside} and \textbf{outside} academia and the ways in which these benefits could be brought about.

\chapter*{COVID-19 Statement}

In March of 2020, 18 months into the development of this thesis, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the UK, forcing it into lockdowns which would continue for over a year. Solely by good fortune and a tendency to speed ahead with too-little thought, the primary data collection had fortunately been completed prior to the first lockdown. However, this work was impacted in three ways:

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Further in-situ data collection could not be completed, reducing the range of soundscape types we could include;
      \item The unprecedented and stressful world of the pandemic had a significant mental health and social impact, the effects of which cannot be quantified, nor overstated;
      \item In response to the unique scientific opportunity of a world-wide transportation and social lockdown, new, unplanned studies were carried out.
\end{enumerate}

In particular, this final point has had an impact on the structure and content of this thesis. Certain aspects of the research, in particular the model development and building, were accelerated and put into practice to investigate the impacts of the COVID lockdowns, before being returned to and further developed. The initial research plan would have followed a more logical path of nailing down the model development first, then moving on to a first implementation. In addition, new work was added to this thesis which may appear incongruous or unrelated, but represents a great deal of necessary work which further informed the key strains of the thesis.

\part{A novel application of predictive soundscape modelling}
\section*{Introduction}

The ability to predict the likely soundscape assessment of urban spaces has great potential for bringing a soundscape focus to design, but it also unlocks new opportunities to track how urban spaces change. In order to demonstrate this potential, and to give a practical example of the principles I have outlined in this thesis, this part presents a novel application of predictive soundscape modelling used to track how the \gls{covid19} lockdowns impacted urban soundscapes. The model presented in \cref{ch:lockdown}\footnote{The study presented in \cref{ch:lockdown} has been published as \citep{Mitchell2021Investigating} in a special issue on \gls{covid19} Pandemic Acoustic Effects. } represents a first-step approach which will be further built upon and developed throughout the following chapters in \cref{part:generalModel}.

\part{Towards a Generalisable and Probablistic Soundscape Model}
\label{part:generalModel}
\section*{Introduction}
\cref{ch:lockdown} has demonstrated a novel application of predictive soundscape modelling. Given the conditions of the \gls{covid19} lockdowns, existing soundscape assessment methods were impractical (or illegal) to implement. As outlined in \cref{ch:lit}, this is an example of one of the scenarios where predictive modelling is necessary, as the existing \emph{post-hoc} survey methods cannot be used. Other applicable scenarios include: soundscape mapping, predicting soundscapes of not-yet-existing spaces, unattended sensor networks, and long-term soundscape monitoring.

The model in \cref{ch:lockdown} represents an advance for current soundscape methods and provided valuable insight into the likely soundscape during the \gls{covid19} lockdown. However, it does not yet represent a generalisable soundscape model which would be neccesary to address these other applications of predictive modelling. Towards this goal, I therefore present a forward-looking proposal for expanding this model to include the additional types of soundscape indicators introduced in \cref{ch:lit}.

In \cref{ch:bayes} I develop the overall requirements of a generalised predictive soundscape model and the development constraints that these requirements place on such a model. I describe how we can begin to build on the model from \cref{ch:lockdown}, incorporating architectural and visual information, and make it generalisable to new locations, contexts, and applications.

\cref{ch:mlmann} addresses the necessity of incorporating semantic information about the sound source type into a model for predicting soundscape perception. I illustrate how this information can be integrated by presenting the results of my study on predicting noise annoyance with a \gls{mlm} incorporating sound source information \citep{Orga2021Multilevel}\footnote{The content in this study and chapter are my own work, conducted as part of this thesis. I shared first-authorship with Dr. Ferran Orga for the published version and his contributions to the text included in the chapter are clearly marked and referenced. }. \draft{In addition, since the data for this study was collected via a \gls{wasn}, I also propose how sophisticated soundscape models can be integrated into unmanned sensor networks.}

In \cref{ch:whostudy} I investigate to what extent personal factors (e.g. age, gender, psychological well-being) influence soundscape perception. I constructed a third \gls{mlm} and performed feature selection to determine the relative importance of these personal factors \citep{Erfanian2021Psychological}\footnote{The content in this study and chapter are my own work, conducted as part of this thesis. I shared co-authorship with Ms. Mercede Erfanian for the published version. The text included in this chapter represents my portion of the original work. Where Ms. Erfanian drafted the original text, this has been clearly indicated and referenced.}. Several approaches for how this information could be integrated into a practical predictive model are proposed, following the constraints laid out in \cref{ch:bayes}.

Finally, in \cref{ch:ProbabilisticPOC} I present a new method for analysing and representing soundscape assessments, published as \citet{Mitchell2022How}. This method emphasises the necessity of considering the variation in people's responses to a soundscape. Given this variation, the soundscape of a space cannot be represented by an single person's assessment, but is better thought of as a collective perception. As such, the method I have developed represents a soundscape as a distribution of soundscape assessments. This chapter introduces this visualisation method and its implications. I also provide a proof-of-concept demonstration for how a predictive soundscape model can reflect this consideration of the natural variation in perception.
