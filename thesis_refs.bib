In ecology, an infrastructure consisting of networks of interconnected sensors can provide in-situ high-precision monitoring of natural phenomena at a large-scale. Moreover, WSNs provide a number of advantages to ecoinformatics such as the possibility of constructing quality datasets that coupled to machine learning-based prediction systems, can be used for ecological and process modelling. In this manuscript, we present a survey on recent WSNs based on several fields related to environmental research e.g. ecoinformatics, precision agriculture and wildlife observation. Finally, we have focused on the identification of limitations and open problems therein.},

    abstract = {Endowing machines with sensing capabilities similar to those of humans is a prevalent quest in engineering and computer science. In the pursuit of making computers sense their surroundings, a huge effort has been conducted to allow machines and computers to acquire, process, analyze and understand their environment in a human-like way. Focusing on the sense of hearing, the ability of computers to sense their acoustic environment as humans do goes by the name of machine hearing. To achieve this ambitious aim, the representation of the audio signal is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present an up-to-date review of the most relevant audio feature extraction techniques developed to analyze the most usual audio signals: speech, music and environmental sounds. Besides revisiting classic approaches for completeness, we include the latest advances in the field based on new domains of analysis together with novel bio-inspired proposals. These approaches are described following a taxonomy that organizes them according to their physical or perceptual basis, being subsequently divided depending on the domain of computation (time, frequency, wavelet, image-based, cepstral, or other domains). The description of the approaches is accompanied with recent examples of their application to machine hearing related problems.},

Yet, more empirical evidence is needed about the benefits of experiencing positive soundscapes for health, well-being and quality of life. In this study, a pilot questionnaire was distributed to 50 users of a public open space in London (Granary Square), which consisted of a standardized protocol for collecting soundscape data (ISO 12913-2:2018, Method A), the World Health Organisation-Five Well-Being questionnaire (WHO-5) and a short protocol to assess perceived safety. Results show that associations between negative soundscape dimensions and lower well-being scores exist at a statistically significant level (p {\textless} .05) and other further insights into the relationships between sound perception and perceived safety. By making a stronger case for policy makers and planners, these findings contribute to the discourse of approaching the management of the urban acoustic environments in a proactive rather than reactive way, to promote healthy and supportive urban spaces.},

In order to predict how people would perceive an acoustic environment, it is central to identify the underlying acoustic properties of soundscapes. In this study these properties were approached by investigating the visual similarity of colour prints of 50 audio spectrograms (time vs. frequency), representing audio recordings of a variety of acoustic environments. In total, 15 female and 15 male students from the University of Sheffield were recruited to assess the 50 spectrograms by sorting them into groups based on how similar they were perceived to be. A distance matrix, derived from the sorting data, was subjected to a Multidimensional Scaling analysis to map the underlying dimensions of similarity among the spectrograms, which are proposed to represent the underlying acoustic properties of the corresponding acoustic environments. Three dimensions were identified. The first dimension relates to Distinguishable–Indistinguishable sound sources, the second dimension to Background–Foreground sounds, and the third dimension to Intrusive–Smooth sound sources. The results also show that established acoustic parameters are inappropriate as indicators of acoustic environments and that further research is needed in this field.},

    abstract  = {Soundscape research needs to develop predictive tools for environmental design. A number of descriptor-indicator(s) models have been proposed so far, particularly for the "tranquility" dimension to manage "quiet areas" in urban contexts. However, there is a current lack of models addressing environments offering actively engaging soundscapes, i.e., the "vibrancy" dimension. The main aim of this study was to establish a predictive model for a vibrancy descriptor based on physical parameters, which could be used by designers and practitioners. A group interview was carried out to formulate a hypothesis on what elements would be influential for vibrancy perception. Afterwards, data on vibrancy perception were collected for different locations in the UK and China through a laboratory experiment and their physical parameters were used as indicators to establish a predictive model. Such indicators included both aural and visual parameters. The model, based on Roughness, Presence of People, Fluctuation Strength, Loudness and Presence of Music as predictors, explained 76{\%} of the variance in the mean individual vibrancy scores. A statistically significant correlation was found between vibrancy scores and eventfulness scores, but not between vibrancy scores and pleasantness scores. Overall results showed that vibrancy is contextual and depends both on the soundscape and on the visual scenery.},

In order to monitor critical locations, Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks are being deployed, mainly in European and American cities. These networks focus primarily on measuring noise levels associated with road traffic. However, a number of different sounds are also present in urban areas and if our overall aim is to improve the quality of life of city inhabitants, then these additional sounds should be considered in accordance with the soundscape approach. This think piece proposes a step forward in the analysis of citizens' perception of noise annoyance. We want to analyse the degree of annoyance caused by different sounds and study how this is related to psychoacoustic parameters. To this end, we propose to assess the acoustic environment by conducting perceptual tests on data gathered in a noise monitoring network. The proposed methodology is presented and discussed, and several open questions are posed to the research community.},

This study reports on modeling pleasantness in urban context using perceptual assessments and sound measurements for specific locations during an urban walk. These assessments have been collected from four groups of approximately ten participants on 19 different assessment locations, along a 2.1 km-long path traveled in both directions. Simultaneously, 1/3-octave band sound levels and audio were recorded. Perceptual and physical models of pleasantness are proposed for specific locations based on multiple linear regressions. A multilevel analysis was performed, and it is shown that a perceptual model that includes perceived loudness joined to the perceived time of presence of traffic, voices and birds explains 90{\%} of the pleasantness variance due to the sound environment variations. Physical models that include the original acoustic indicators that are most correlated with perceptual variables explain 85{\%} of this variance. Thanks to these models, a unique averaged pleasantness value is defined for each assessment location from the perceptual or physical collected assessments. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the averaged perceived pleasantness and the modeled values from perceptual assessment reaches r(19) = 0.98, and r(19) = 0.97, with the modeled values from physical measurements. These results make it possible to consider the use of this kind of models in a cartographic context. As the path was traveled in both directions, the presentation-order effect has also been assessed, and it has been found that path direction did not have a significant impact on the pleasantness assessment at specific locations, except when very strong sound environment changes occurred. Finally, the study gives some insights about the retrospective global pleasantness assessment for urban walks. For very short walks between two assessment locations, a recency effect is shown. Nevertheless, this effect doesn't seem to be significant when longer routes are assessed.},

    abstract  = {An attribute-profiling tool, customized for 106 residents' structured listening walks, was developed for measuring "soundscape quality" in 24 kinds of listening places representing four urban residential areas exposed to road-traffic noise. The tool's 12 attributes were matched to the soundscape on a scale from 0 to 100{\%}. The attributes were: soothing, pleasant, light, dull, eventful, exciting, stressful, hard, intrusive, annoying, noisy, and loud. In total, the soundscape quality of 636 unique 30-s soundscapes was measured. For food soundscape quality (pleasant and soothing) to predominate outdoors, the overall sound level of soundscapes had to be below ca. 50 dB LAeq,30s. Indoor soundscapes (closed windows) at exposed sides of buildings were found to be of inferior quality compared to outdoor soundscapes at shielded sides. This was true although the former soundscapes were 14 dB LAeq,30s lower than the latter. A PCA analysis of the 12-attribute profiles of the 24 kinds of listening places showed that residents actually perceived "signatures" of soundscape quality linked to the origin of soundscapes, whether indoor or outdoors. All soundscapes at shielded sides indoors with closed windows clustered together with the indoor and outdoor soundscapes in the low road-traffic noise exposed residential area. Conversely, at building sides with high traffic-noise exposure, all soundscapes, outdoors or indoors with open window, clustered together with their outdoor soundscapes at the shielded sides. The new attribute-profiling tool is promising because it measures soundscape quality beyond unwanted sounds and mere sound level of predominant noise.},

Over the last decade, smart phone ownership has increased immeasurably and this technology has been applied here in order to allow in situ soundscape assessment as participants go about their daily routine. Crowdsourcing data in this way has enormous potential to create rich and diverse data sets, where both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of environmental surroundings can be gathered in a flexible and non-invasive way. The application allows the collection and assessment of environmental soundscapes using the provided set of response questions and exploiting the native audio recording application on a GPS-enabled smart phone. This paper outlines the methodological approach used for the study and the technology employed by describing the submission procedure and the back-end processes involved in handling and collecting the data. Preliminary results from an experience sampling pilot study will also be presented and discussed as well as providing insight for future uses of such technology. The authors also propose future work with regards to the development of the application and the inclusion of crowdsourced data within an interactive online map. The continual contribution to the map allows for an evolving understanding on the public perception of environmental soundscapes.},

    abstract  = {The aims of this work were to investigate (i) whether soundscape perceptual dimensions are correctly reproduced by ambisonic loudspeaker playback, (ii) whether soundscape dimensional analysis is robust to changes of location and from the field to laboratory playback, and (iii) whether a simple soundscape synthesis can be used to interactively design a soundscape. The first two aims were addressed by an experiment which attempted to repeat the dimensional analysis made by Kang [1]. Kang used semantic differential scales to conduct an in-situ survey of two urban soundscapes in Sheffield, UK. He used factor analysis to derive four perceptual dimensions from the responses. The present work repeated this approach, but the fifteen participants were judging ambisonic recordings of four soundscapes in Manchester, UK. The present work found very similar dimensions to Kang but with more variance explained: relaxation/calmness (41{\%}), dynamics/vibrancy (10{\%}), communication (7{\%}) and spatiality (7{\%}). The dimensions from the two studies load onto the semantic scales in a similar way. These results indicate that an ambisonic reproduction of a soundscape gives similar results to field experiments, though with more variance explained. They also show that dimensional analysis of soundscape response is robust enough to produce similar results for different locations in different cities. To investigate the third aim, the ambisonic reproduction was extended to a system which allowed independent interactive control of sixteen foreground sounds set in an ambisonic background soundscape. Eight participants were able to use this system to successfully design a soundscape that expressed their intentions. It was found that the designed soundscapes seemed to be based more on participant expectation of typical urban soundscapes than on their preference for individual sounds. These results suggest that a more sophisticated soundscape synthesiser might be suitable for real design problems. {\textcopyright} S. Hirzel Verlag EAA.},

    abstract  = {The advent of realistic yet affordable immersive audio-visual recording and reproduction systems that combine binaural or spatial audio with 360-degree video, backed by increasingly efficient and realistic acoustic simulation and auralization models, has led to an increased interest in the acoustic design of urban environments. Architects and designers are however well-known to work by example. One of the goals of the Urban Soundscapes of the World project is therefore to compile a comprehensive reference database of high quality immersive audio-visual recordings of urban sites, within a range of cities worldwide. The well-documented exemplars in this database can be used to serve as an ecologically valid baseline for assessing the perceptual influence of noise control and soundscaping measures through auralization. This paper reports on a perception-based protocol that was developed for the purpose of site selection, in particular for systematically identifying spots within a city with a specific soundscape. This protocol contains an online questionnaire that is conducted among panels of local experts, and that asks participants to pinpoint outdoor public spaces within the city that are perceived in specific ways, regarding the presence of sound sources, the core affect and emotion evoked, and the appropriateness of the sound environment. This approach was designed to lead to a range of urban sites with a wide variety of soundscapes, such that a good statistical power can be achieved in perception experiments that are conducted on the basis of the audio-visual recordings in the database.},

    abstract      = {According to 4 acoustical parameters of noise samples (i.e., loudness, sharpness, fluctuation strength and roughness), Zwicker's psychoacoustic annoyance model can be used to estimate the relative degree of noise annoyance. However, this model cannot be well applied to compare the annoyance degrees of tonal noises and atonal noises. In order to improve its estimation effect on tonal noises, 3 groups of noise samples were selected randomly, i.e., 27 low-frequency tonal noise samples induced by a 1000 kV transformer with A-weighted equivalent sound pressure levels ranging from 41.2 dBA to 73.0 dBA; 30 low-, mid- or high-frequency tonal/atonal noise samples with loudness levels ranging from 60 phon to 80 phon; and 60 other noise samples with A-weighted equivalent sound pressure levels ranging from 40.7 dBA to 75.0 dBA. Laboratory listening tests were conducted on the above 3 sample groups respectively via an 11-point numerical scale. The Zwicker's psychoacoustic annoyance model was improved by taking tonality into account, and introducing the evaluation result of the first noise sample group (1000 kV transformer noise samples) to determine the coefficients in the model. The applicability of the improved model was examined by the evaluation results of the other two groups as well as the data in a previous research on annoyance of 220 kV/500 kV transformer noises. Results show that the improved model can estimate the relative annoyance degrees caused by various types of tonal/atonal noises much more accurately.},

Recent Findings: The ISO 12913-2 establishes ways of data collection and reporting requirements for soundscape studies (International Organization for Standartization 2017), including the triangulation technique. This standard recommends some data collection methods, like soundwalks and interviews. Even so, some authors are using different methods to collect data, such as focus group and listening tests. Summary: This study investigated through 52 peer-reviewed papers published on the last 20 years the current status of socio-acoustic studies regarding question topics and types, used stimuli, and characteristics about the participants, using the four major adopted data collection methods in soundscape studies: soundwalks, interviews, listening tests, and focus group. Some topics like “soundscape quality” and “sound sources identification and evaluation” are common in the recent studies, as well as the adoption of some question types such as semantic differential scale, the staple scale, and ranking order scale.},

    abstract = {Audio/visual recognition and retrieval applications have recently garnered significant attention within Internet-of-Things-oriented services, given that video cameras and audio processing chipsets are now ubiquitous even in low-end embedded systems. In the most typical scenario for such services, each device extracts audio/visual features and compacts them into feature descriptors, which comprise media queries. These queries are uploaded to a remote cloud computing service that performs content matching for classification or retrieval applications. Two of the most crucial aspects for such services are: 1) controlling the device energy consumption when using the service, and 2) reducing the billing cost incurred from the cloud infrastructure provider. In this paper, we derive analytic conditions for the optimal coupling between the device energy consumption and the incurred cloud infrastructure billing. Our framework encapsulates: the energy consumption to produce and transmit audio/visual queries, the billing rates of the cloud infrastructure, the number of devices concurrently connected to the same cloud server, the query volume constraint of each cluster of devices, and the statistics of the query data production volume per device. Our analytic results are validated via a deployment with: 1) the device side comprising compact image descriptors (queries) computed on Beaglebone Linux embedded platforms and transmitted to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service, and 2) the cloud side carrying out image similarity detection via AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, with the AWS Auto Scaling being used to control the number of instances according to the demand.},

%Botteldooren2012: The World Health Organization (WHO) “Burden of disease by environmental noise” report [1] quantifies the negative effects of long-term exposure to road traffic noise levels. Estimates in terms of “disability-adjusted life-years” (DALYs) list sleep disturbance, annoyance, ischemic heart diseases, cognitive impairment of children and tinnitus as major health effects, leading to a loss of about one million healthy life years every year in western Europe.

    abstract  = {Soundscape exists through human perception of the acoustic environment. This paper investigates how soundscape currently is assessed and measured. It reviews and analyzes the main soundscape descriptors in the soundscape literature, and provides a conceptual framework for developing predictive models in soundscape studies. A predictive soundscape model provides a means of predicting the value of a soundscape descriptor, and the blueprint for how to design soundscape. It is the key for implementing the soundscape approach in urban planning and design. The challenge is to select the appropriate soundscape descriptor and to identify its predictors. The majority of available soundscape descriptors are converging towards a 2-dimensional soundscape model of perceived affective quality (e.g., Pleasantness-Eventfulness, or Calmness-Vibrancy). A third potential dimension is the appropriateness of a soundscape to a place. This dimensions provides complementary information beyond the perceived affective quality. However, it depends largely on context, and because a soundscape may be appropriate to a place although it is poor, this descriptor must probably not be used on its own. With regards to predictors, or soundscape indicators, perceived properties of the acoustic environment (e.g., perceived sound sources) are winning over established acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics. To move this area forward it is necessary that the international soundscape community comes together and agrees on relevant soundscape descriptors. This includes to agree on numerical scales and assessment procedures, as well as to standardize them.},

Traditionally, research on urban noise was conducted through surveys with a limited temporal and spatial coverage, and focused on a subset of the wide spectrum of sounds sources present in an urban environment. To overcome these limitations, we use geo-referenced social media images from Flickr to characterize the soundscape of London at scale. We build a model that uses socioeconomic variables, official noise exposure levels, and the soundscape estimated from social media to predict at area level the prevalence of hypertension-a cardiovascular condition that is widely studied in connection to high noise exposure. We consistently observe that socioeconomic variables, such as age, gender, and income, play an important role in explaining hypertension rates. Official noise exposure levels add a relatively limited contribution in predicting the health outcome. On the contrary, the social media soundscape information considerably improves the model performance. This result speaks to the value of integrating social media data into strategic noise maps for enhancing their predictive power; it also hints at the fact that the presence (or absence) of specific types of sounds might be a better indicator of hypertension prevalence than noise levels themselves.},

Approaches for classifying sounds are commonly based on supervised learning algorithms, which require labeled data which is often scarce and leads to models that do not generalize well. In this paper, we make an efficient combination of confidence-based Active Learning and Self-Training with the aim of minimizing the need for human annotation for sound classification model training. The proposed method pre-processes the instances that are ready for labeling by calculating their classifier confidence scores, and then delivers the candidates with lower scores to human annotators, and those with high scores are automatically labeled by the machine. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of this method in two practical scenarios: pool-based and stream-based processing. Extensive experimental results indicate that our approach requires significantly less labeled instances to reach the same performance in both scenarios compared to Passive Learning, Active Learning and Self-Training. A reduction of 52.2\% in human labeled instances is achieved in both of the pool-based and stream-based scenarios on a sound classification task considering 16,930 sound instances.},

    abstract = {The work presented in this article studies how the context information can be used in the automatic sound event detection process, and how the detection system can benefit from such information. Humans are using context information to make more accurate predictions about the sound events and ruling out unlikely events given the context. We propose a similar utilization of context information in the automatic sound event detection process. The proposed approach is composed of two stages: automatic context recognition stage and sound event detection stage. Contexts are modeled using Gaussian mixture models and sound events are modeled using three-state left-to-right hidden Markov models. In the first stage, audio context of the tested signal is recognized. Based on the recognized context, a context-specific set of sound event classes is selected for the sound event detection stage. The event detection stage also uses context-dependent acoustic models and count-based event priors. Two alternative event detection approaches are studied. In the first one, a monophonic event sequence is outputted by detecting the most prominent sound event at each time instance using Viterbi decoding. The second approach introduces a new method for producing polyphonic event sequence by detecting multiple overlapping sound events using multiple restricted Viterbi passes. A new metric is introduced to evaluate the sound event detection performance with various level of polyphony. This combines the detection accuracy and coarse time-resolution error into one metric, making the comparison of the performance of detection algorithms simpler. The two-step approach was found to improve the results substantially compared to the context-independent baseline system. In the block-level, the detection accuracy can be almost doubled by using the proposed context-dependent event detection.},

One of the most common challenges faced when trying to perform classification is the class imbalance problem. A number of sampling approaches, ranging from under-sampling to over-sampling, have been developed to solve the problem of class imbalance. This chapter provides an overview of the sampling strategies as well as classification algorithms developed for countering class imbalance. It considers the issues of correctly evaluating the performance of a classifier on imbalanced datasets and presents a discussion on various metrics. The sampling techniques discussed here include under-sampling, over-sampling, hybrid techniques and ensemble-based methods. Methods have also been developed that aim to directly combat class imbalance without the need for sampling. These methods come mainly from the cost-sensitive learning community; however, classifiers that deal with imbalance are not necessarily cost-sensitive learners.},

    abstract  = {With the advent of virtual reality (VR) technology, spatial audio has been increasingly adopted to evaluate the acoustic environment in soundscape research. It is therefore imperative to assess the quality of commonly used spatial audio reproduction methods to determine their ecological validity. Through subjective evaluations with 30 participants, the same participant evaluated four outdoor in situ locations vis-{\`{a}}-vis its corresponding audio- visual recording in VR on a separate day. A total of three spatial audio reproduction methods were assessed in VR, and they were all down-mixed from the first-order ambisonics (FOA) recordings to headphone-based FOA- static binaural, FOA-tracked binaural; and FOA 2-dimensional (2D) octagonal speaker array. The participants evaluated the acoustic environment in terms of the overall soundscape quality and perceived spatial qualities at each location. Regarding overall soundscape quality, there were no significant differences in evaluating the sound-source dominance and affective soundscape qualities between in situ and all VR methods. However, significant differences were found in the perceived spatial qualities between three reproduction methods and in situ. Among the source-related spatial attributes, the perceived distance of the dominating sounds was farther in the virtual than in the in situ evaluations. In the localization of sound sources, both the FOA-tracked binaural and the FOA-2D speaker array exhibited higher spatial acoustic fidelity than FOA-static binaural. Regarding the environment-related spatial quality attributes, the 2D speaker array reproduction was perceived as more im- mersive and realistic than other reproduction methods. Overall, the FOA-tracked binaural appears to exhibit sufficient fidelity for cinematic VR evaluation of soundscapes.},

Three well-known problems with ANOVA are the sphericity assumption, the design effect (sampling hierarchy), and the requirement for complete designs and data sets. This tutorial explains and demonstrates multi-level modeling (MLM) as an alternative analysis tool for repeated measures data. MLM allows us to estimate variance and covariance components explicitly. MLM does not require sphericity, it takes the sampling hierarchy into account, and it is capable of analyzing incomplete data. A fictitious data set is analyzed with MLM and ANOVA, and analysis results are compared. Moreover, existing data from a repeated measures design are re-analyzed with MLM, to demonstrate its advantages. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that MLM yields higher power than ANOVA, in particular under realistic circumstances. Although technically complex, MLM is recommended as a useful tool for analyzing repeated measures data from speech research.},

    abstract = {Noise pollution caused by vehicular traffic is a common problem in urban environments that has been shown to affect people's health and children's cognition. In the last decade, several studies have been conducted to assess this noise, by measuring the equivalent noise pressure level (called Leq) to acquire an accurate sound map using wireless networks with acoustic sensors. However, even with similar values of Leq, people can feel the noise differently according to its frequency characteristics. Thus, indexes, which can express people's feelings by subjective measures, are required. In this paper, we analyze the suitability of using the psychoacoustic metrics given by the Zwicker's model, instead of just only considering Leq. The goal is to evaluate the hardware limitations of a low-cost wireless acoustic sensor network that is used to measure the annoyance, using two types of commercial and off-the-shelf sensor nodes, Tmote-Invent nodes and Raspberry Pi platforms. Moreover, to calculate the parameters using these platforms, different simplifications to the Zwicker's model based on the specific features of road traffic noise are proposed. To validate the different alternatives, the aforementioned nodes are tested in a traffic congested area of Valencia City in a vertical and horizontal network deployment. Based on the results, it is observed that the Raspberry Pi platforms are a feasible low-cost alternative to increase the spatial-temporal resolution, whereas Tmote-Invent nodes do not confirm their suitability due to their limited memory and calibration issues.},

%These results, if generalized to other urban areas with high levels of road traffic, indicate that it may be important for the public's health to update existing noise-related policies or develop new ones to control and abate noise concerns in urban communities.

This paper outlines an ongoing European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant project, which aims to establish “soundscape indices” (SSID). By taking psychological, (psycho)acoustical, neural and physiological, and contextual factors into account, SSID will adequately reflect levels of human comfort to integrate side-by-side with (and eventually replace) decibel-based metrics into existing (international) regulations, shifting the focus from noise control to a more holistic approach. Steps to achieve this include: to characterise soundscapes, by capturing acoustic environments and establishing a comprehensive database; to identify key factors and their influence on soundscape quality based on the database, by conducting laboratory psychological evaluations, acoustical/psychoacoustic factors analysis, and also, to research the neural and psychophysiological underpinnings of soundscape experience, by applying techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Skin Conductance Response (SCR); to develop, test and validate the soundscape indices, by analysing the influences of various factors; to demonstrate the applicability of the soundscape indices in practice, by establishing frameworks for soundscape prediction, design, and standardisation. Ultimately, the findings of SSID will allow for an easy assessment of public spaces and the increase of the noise management impact.},

The ten questions presented in this paper range from the very basic definitions underlying the emerging soundscape ‘science', to more applied topics about how to use soundscape as a design approach for the planning and management of the built environments. Although significant research activity has been conducted so far, there is still a need to systematically provide the underpinning science and practical guidance in soundscaping.

    abstract  = {Urban soundscapes are dynamic and complex multivariable environmental systems. Soundscapes can be organized into three main entities containing the multiple variables: Experienced Environment (EE), Acoustic Environment (AE), and Extra-Acoustic Environment (XE). This work applies a multidimensional and synchronic data-collecting methodology at eight urban environments in the city of C{\'{o}}rdoba, Argentina. The EE was assessed by means of surveys, the AE by acoustic measurements and audio recordings, and the XE by photos, video, and complementary sources. In total, 39 measurement locations were considered, where data corresponding to 61 AE and 203 EE were collected. Multivariate analysis and GIS techniques were used for data processing. The types of sound sources perceived, and their extents make up part of the collected variables that belong to the EE, i.e. traffic, people, natural sounds, and others. Sources explaining most of the variance were traffic noise and natural sounds. Thus, a Green Soundscape Index (GSI) is defined here as the ratio of the perceived extents of natural sounds to traffic noise. Collected data were divided into three ranges according to GSI value: 1) perceptual predominance of traffic noise, 2) balanced perception, and 3) perceptual predominance of natural sounds. For each group, three additional variables from the EE and three from the AE were applied, which reported significant differences, especially between ranges 1 and 2 with 3. These results confirm the key role of perceiving natural sounds in a town environment and also support the proposal of a GSI as a valuable indicator to classify urban soundscapes. In addition, the collected GSI-related data significantly helps to assess the overall soundscape. It is noted that this proposed simple perceptual index not only allows one to assess and classify urban soundscapes but also contributes greatly toward a technique for separating environmental sound sources.},

    abstract  = {The soundscape paradigm is comprised of complex living systems where individuals interact moment-by-moment among one another and with the physical environment. The real environments provide promising conditions to reveal deep soundscape behavior, including the multiple components involved and their interrelations as a whole. However, measuring and analyzing the numerous simultaneous variables of soundscape represents a challenge that is not completely understood. This work proposes and applies a comprehensive methodology for multidimensional and synchronic data collection in soundscape. The soundscape variables were organized into three main entities: experienced environment, acoustic environment, and extra-acoustic environment, containing, in turn, subgroups of variables called components. The variables contained in these components were acquired through synchronic field techniques that include surveys, acoustic measurements, audio recordings, photography, and video. The proposed methodology was tested, optimized, and applied in diverse open environments, including squares, parks, fountains, university campuses, streets, and pedestrian areas. The systematization of this comprehensive methodology provides a framework for soundscape research, a support for urban and environment management, and a preliminary procedure for standardization in soundscape data collecting.},

    abstract       = {Noise is an ever-growing problem in cities. Conventional noise mitigation approaches may not necessarily control noise pollution, since whether a sound is perceived as noise is largely influenced by its specific contexts. Based on an activity-centric framework, this study examines the effects of activity-related contexts and measured sound levels based on individuals' sound evaluations as they undertake daily activities at different geographic locations and times. Data for the study were collected from 33 participants in Chicago (USA) using Global Positioning System-equipped mobile phones, portable sound sensors, and activity diaries. Multilevel logistic modeling was used to examine the relationships among measured sound levels, sound evaluations, and activity-related contexts for each recorded activity of the participants. The results indicate that activity-related contexts significantly influence individuals' sound evaluations as they perform their daily activities. When activity-related contexts are taken into account, the measured sound levels that individuals experienced when performing an activity are no longer significant in influencing their sound evaluations. These results support the notion that sound is not only a physical feature but also a socio-psychological construct. It is crucial to adopt a human-centric and context-aware approach in urban planning through understanding the circumstances in which a sound is perceived as noise. Such an approach would help improve sound-related urban environments and construct livable and healthy cities.},

%The goal of this project is to turn GPS-equipped mobile phones into noise sensors that enable citizens to measure their personal exposure to noise in their everyday environment. Thus each user can contribute by sharing their geo-localised measurements and further personal annotation to produce a collective noise map.

This study aims at analysing the distribution of these deviances and possible systematic errors in the scaling. Data were collected through surveys in public open spaces in the UK, Italy and China. Statistical analyses were con- ducted over the pairs “pleasant-annoying”, “vibrant-monotonous”, “calm-chaotic”, and “eventful-uneventful” with corresponding 5-point Likert scales. The results show a scaling bias effect over adjectives that belong to the same semantic dimension. In particular, participants who gave a neutral evaluation of the adjective “pleas- ant”, show a systematically greater disagreement with “annoying” whereas the agreement is significantly lower. Similar patterns are observed across other pairs of adjectives. A further analysis revealed that only a small percentage of participants gave an evaluation for each pair of adjectives within a 1-point scale distance.},

The methods for developing soundscape models are hereby questioned by investigating the following aspects: data acquisition methods, indicators used as predictors of descriptors in the models, descriptors targeted as output of the models, linear rather than non-linear model fitting, and overall performances. The inclusion criteria for the reviewed studies were: models dealing with soundscape dimensions aligned with the definitions provided in the ISO 12913 series; models based on soundscape data sampled at least at two different locations and using at least two variables as indicators. The Scopus database was queried. Biases on papers selection were considered and those related to the methods are discussed in the current study. Out of 256 results from Scopus, 22 studies were selected. Two studies were included from the references among the results. The data extraction from the 24 studies includes: data collection methods, input and output for the models, and model performance. Three main data collection methods were found. Several studies focus on the different combination of indicators among physical measurements, perceptual evaluations, temporal dynamics, demographic and psychological information, context information and visual amenity. The descriptors considered across the studies include: acoustic comfort, valence, arousal, calmness, chaoticness, sound quality, tranquillity, and vibrancy. The interpretation of the results is limited by the large variety of methods, and the large number of parameters in spite of a limited amount of studies obtained from the query. However, perceptual indicators, visual and contextual indicators, as well as time dynamic embedding, overall provide a better prediction of soundscape. Finally, although the compared performance between linear and non-linear methods does not show remarkable differences, non-linear methods might still represent a more suitable choice in models where complex structures of indicators are used.},

It was therefore becoming essential to provide information that is easier to understand and more closely reflects the reality of noise nuisances as they are perceived by the public.

    abstract = {The soundscape is defined by the International Standard Organization (ISO) 12913-1 as the human's perception of the acoustic environment, in context, accompanying physiological and psychological responses. Previous research is synthesized with studies designed to investigate soundscape at the ‘unconscious' level in an effort to more specifically conceptualize biomarkers of the soundscape. This review aims firstly, to investigate the consistency of methodologies applied for the investigation of physiological aspects of soundscape; secondly, to underline the feasibility of physiological markers as biomarkers of soundscape; and finally, to explore the association between the physiological responses and the well-founded psychological components of the soundscape which are continually advancing. For this review, Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO were searched for peer-reviewed articles published in English with combinations of the keywords ‘soundscape', ‘environmental noise/sound', ‘physiology/physiological', ‘psychology/psychological', and ‘perceptual attributes/affective/subjective assessment/appraisals'. Previous research suggests that Electrocardiography (ECG) and Vectorcardiography (VCG) biometrics quantifying Heart Rate (HR), stimulus-locked experimental design, and passive listening with homogeneous populations are predominantly applied to characterize the psychophysiology underlying the soundscape. Pleasantness and arousal are the most frequent psychological descriptors for soundscape subjective appraisals. Likewise, acoustic environments are reported to inconsistently evoke physiological responses with great variability among studies. The link between the perceptual attributes and physiological responses of soundscape vary within and among existing literature. While a few studies detected a link between physiological manifestations of soundscape and the perceptual attributes, the others failed to validate this link. Additionally, the majority of the study findings were limited to one or two physiological responses.},

The system output in this case contains overlapping events, marked as multiple sounds detected as being active at the same time. The polyphonic system output requires a suitable procedure for evaluation against a reference. Metrics from neighboring fields such as speech recognition and speaker diarization can be used, but they need to be partially redefined to deal with the overlapping events. We present a review of the most common metrics in the field and the way they are adapted and interpreted in the polyphonic case. We discuss segment-based and event-based definitions of each metric and explain the consequences of instance-based and class-based averaging using a case study. In parallel, we provide a toolbox containing implementations of presented metrics.},

This study investigates the presence of a 1/f structure in the power spectrum slope of six (psycho)acoustical parameters of 30-s recordings of urban acoustic environments. The acoustical parameters were calculated as time series throughout the recording period, then the power spectrum of the time series was calculated and plotted on a log-log scale, with the x-axis ranging from 30 s/10-1.5 Hz to 0.01 s/102 Hz. The slope of the best-fitted straight line through the power spectrum was calculated and compared to the corresponding perceptual attribute ratings of the soundscape collected on site during the recording. The dataset includes 300 + recording-response pairs. An overall 1/f structure was not found for any of the parameters. Differences in temporal behaviour are indicated at different time scales, with a deviation in slope typically occurring at ∼2 s/0.5 Hz, reflecting differences in temporal behaviour among within-sound-event time scales and between-sound-event time scales. An ordinal logistic regression model is developed which predicts the perceptual attributes of urban soundscapes based on the spectral slopes of the acoustic time series.},

%Therefore there is also a growing interest in how the quality of a neighborhood is to be assessed and preserved. The appreciation of the living quality of a neighborhood depends on various indicators, which can be grouped into personal attributes, attributes of the house and the characteristics of the neighborhood [2].
%In [2] it is shown that the type of the area where the house is located is more useful in predicting individual neighborhood satisfaction than variables relating to the individual respondent like age, sex or economic status. The type of accommodation (detached house, semi-detached, flat) also contributed significantly to this model.

%Ear-Phone, implemented on Nokia N95 and HP iPAQ mobile devices, also addresses the challenge of collecting accurate noise pollution readings at a mobile device. Extensive simulations and outdoor experiments demonstrate that Ear-Phone is a feasible platform to assess noise pollution, incurring reasonable system resource consumption at mobile devices and providing high reconstruction accuracy of the noise map.

In order to test the proposed method in complex, realistic scenarios, we have built a large, publicly available dataset of audio events. The dataset has allowed us to evaluate the robustness of our method with respect to varying levels of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio; the experimentation has confirmed its applicability under real world conditions, and has shown a significant performance improvement with respect to other methods from the literature.},

    abstract = {An increase in public awareness of noise pollution and the impact of noise on human health has led to the need for enhanced insight in complex noise situations. This insight is commonly obtained either by brief measurements or by evaluation of a simplified acoustic model. Both of these approaches however have limitations in complex noise situations. Noise monitoring can be an appropriate and cost efficient measure to obtain more insight, for it allows to measure at many locations for long periods of time. Monitoring can for example be used to improve the accuracy of models or to assess and respond to changes in the acoustic situation. Several monitoring approaches, for various applications, have been developed or are under development. In the first part of this paper an overview is given of current developments in acoustic monitoring networks and their key aspects. Sensor networks for environmental noise monitoring are here divided into four different categories, distinguished by five aspects: hardware costs, scalability, flexibility, reliability and accuracy. These five aspects determine the range of applications for which a network is suited. In the second part of this paper a monitoring network developed in-house is used to further illustrate the relevance of these aspects. This network was designed to facilitate research into the field of acoustic monitoring networks and is used to experiment with and learn from a broad field of applications. Since the network is not designed for just one application, it has a special focus on flexibility and scalability. This allows the network to cope with the requirement of various applications with different scales. In the third section of this paper three applications of the network are shown to illustrate the five aspects.},

About 3400 questionnaires were analyzed, regarding the global sound environment characterization, the perceived loudness of some emergent sources and the presence time ratio of sources that do not emerge from the background. Sound pressure level was recorded each second from the mobile phone's microphone during a 10-min period. The aim of this study is to propose indicators of urban sound quality based on linear regressions with perceptive variables. A cross validation of the quality models extracted from Paris data was carried out by conducting the same survey in Milan. The proposed sound quality general model is correlated with the real perceived sound quality (72{\%}). Another model without visual amenity and familiarity is 58{\%} correlated with perceived sound quality. In order to improve the sound quality indicator, a site classification was performed by Kohonen's Artificial Neural Network algorithm, and seven specific class models were developed. These specific models attribute more importance on source events and are slightly closer to the individual data than the global model. In general, the Parisian models underestimate the sound quality of Milan environments assessed by Italian people.},

Soundscape categories are established as a result of an automatic clustering algorithm based on multi-parameter analysis by 13 acoustical parameters used as similarity measures, on a large set of sound recordings. One of the main advantages of the followed approach allows to take into account an optimized set of parameters that are judged relevant and necessary for an appropriate description of the sampled acoustical scenarios. The Euclidian distance based clustering of the 370 recordings of typical situations based on these parameters, allows to categorize each binaurally recorded sound sample into one of 20 proposed clusters (soundscape categories). The common features among members within each cluster allow to identify "how the acoustical scenario of the members sounds like". The hybrid use of an optimized set of standard acoustical quantities, such as sound pressure level, together with well known psychoacoustical parameters that directly relate to human perception of sound, makes the propose method very robust.},

% Our findings indicate that a chronic environmental stressor—aircraft noise—could impair cognitive development in children, specifically reading comprehension. Schools exposed to high levels of aircraft noise are not healthy educational environments.

    abstract = {EU Directive 49/2002 and Spanish law 37/2006 urge cities to develop strategic noise maps and action plans to evaluate noise exposure and to establish noise abatement procedures in critical areas. However, noise mapping involves costly and cumbersome measurement procedures that can become a real issue in practice. This paper describes a distributed noise monitoring system based on WASN (Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network) and the application of a geo-statistical methodology for statistical spatial-temporal prediction of noise levels in semi-open areas, such as a typical, small Mediterranean city (Algemes\'{i}, Val\`{e}ncia, Spain). This methodology is applied to the study of the spatial evolution in time of the noise pollution. To this end, a spatial statistical model is developed by using the noise pollution measurements obtained over a set of points located at some strategic locations. The geo-statistical time model allows for estimating specific noise levels and characterizing the spatial-temporal variation of the noise pollution. The results show that the developed model provides a good approximation of the measurements obtained experimentally.},

    abstract       = {It is increasingly acknowledged by landscape architects and urban planners that the soundscape contributes significantly to the perception of urban public open spaces. Describing and classifying this impact, however, remains a challenge. This article presents a hierarchical method for classification that distinguishes between backgrounded and foregrounded, disruptive and supportive, and finally calming and stimulating soundscapes. This four-class classification is applied to a growing collection of immersive audio-visual recordings of sound environments from around the world that could be explored using virtual reality playback. To validate the proposed methodology, an experiment involving 40 participants and 50 soundscape stimuli collected in urban public open spaces worldwide was conducted. The experiment showed that (1)the virtual reality headset reproduction based on affordable spatial audio with 360-degree video recordings was perceived as ecologically valid in terms of realism and immersion; (2)the proposed classification method results in well-separated classes; (3)membership to these classes could be explained by physical parameters, both regarding sound and vision. Moreover, models based on a limited number of acoustical indicators were constructed that could correctly classify a soundscape in each of the four proposed categories, with an accuracy exceeding 88{\%} on an independent dataset.},

From summer 2001 to spring 2002, 9200 interviews were made for four seasons in 14 urban open public spaces across Europe. The results suggest that the subjective evaluation of the sound level generally relates well with the mean Leq, especially when the sound level is below a certain level, which is 73 dBA on the basis of this study. However, considerable differences have been found between the subjective evaluation of the sound level and the acoustic comfort evaluation: people tend to show more tolerance in terms of acoustic comfort evaluation. The background sound level has been found to be an important index in evaluating soundscape in urban open public spaces - a lower background level tends to make people feel quieter. Analyses of individual sound elements show that the acoustic comfort evaluation is greatly affected by the sound source type - introducing a pleasant sound can considerably improve the acoustic comfort, even when its sound level is rather high. No significant difference was found among different age groups in terms of subjective evaluation of a sound level, whereas in terms of acoustic comfort, there were significant differences.},

An intensive questionnaire survey was carried out in two urban squares in Sheffield. Sound identification and classification were both considered. The results show that natural sounds as a group were generally preferred to urban sounds; the preferences of soundscape elements influenced people's choice of using an urban square; and in terms of sound preference, the differences amongst age groups were rather significant, whereas between males and females only slight differences were found. Finally, some suggestions on soundscape design in urban squares are given.},

    abstract       = {Soundscapes in public squares play important roles in urban open spaces. This study aimed to discover the effect of four soundscape dimensions, namely relaxation, communication, spatiality and dynamics, on acoustic comfort in urban open public spaces. A typical city square in China was selected as a case site. Sound environment measurements and questionnaire surveys were carried out for 8 survey positions. The results showed that the perceived dominance of sound sources had a significant effect on relaxation, communication, spatiality and dynamics. Relaxation was greater when the natural sound was perceived dominantly, while it was lower when mechanical sounds or anthropogenic sounds were perceived dominantly. Acoustic comfort had a significant correlation with the soundscape dimensions and LAeq, with spearman's correlation coefficients of 0.495 (relaxation), 0.210 (sound pressure level) and 0.288 (spatiality). In terms of the differences in perceived sound types, acoustic comfort was positively correlated with relaxation when natural sound or anthropogenic sound was perceived dominantly. As spatiality increased, acoustic comfort first decreased and later increased when relaxation was higher, while there were positive correlations between acoustic comfort and relaxation under the other situations. Moreover, when spatiality or communication was higher, there were significant correlations between acoustic comfort and dynamics. According to these results, acoustic comfort can be increased as soundscape dimensions change in an urban open public space.},
